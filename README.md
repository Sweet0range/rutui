# RuTui
RuTui is a leightweight, pure ruby alternative to known Commandline Interface frameworks like nCurses, also in my opinion a lot of better then the build in Curses. (Sure why else had i created it?) Well what i wanted was a library where i can feel free, dont be lamed with DOS's 16 colors default and crazy. nearly C-like statements to create my little cli. This is the result, or the beginning of it.
