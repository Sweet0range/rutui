# RuTui
RuTui is a lightweight, pure ruby alternative to known commandline interface frameworks like nCurses, also in my opinion, kinda better than the built in Curses. (Sure why else had i created this?) Well what i wanted was a library where i can feel free, dont be lamed with DOS's 16 colors default and crazy, nearly C-like statements to create my little cli. This is the result, or the beginning of it.

[**Take a look at the wiki**](https://github.com/b1nary/rutui/wiki)

## Features

-  Fully textbased interfaces
-  No depencies (except ruby)
-  255 Colors (atleast in Unix)
-  FIGlet font support
-  Own dynamic image format
-  Sprites (with animation)
-  Basic themeing
-  ...

You can use this in many different application purposes. You can create simple CLI's for your scripts, you can make awesome ASCII based data visualisations. Its also basicly a small game engine.

## Installation

``` bash
sudo gem install rutui
```
